Safety System With Arduino
Arduino monitors the system working environment including temperature, speed and vibration. If these parameter exceed the allowed values, then Arduino will generate a signal to close the system through a relay. Moreover, there is a application, running on computer, which will get the data sent from Arduino. This application mainly displays the data as graph so that we can analyze if the system is stable or not.
